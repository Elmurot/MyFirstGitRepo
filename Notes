There are 8 locators:
1. id        --> By.id("something") is always unique (almost)to find by the id of the elements
2. name      --> By.name("something") can be repeated to find by the name of elements
3. tagName   --> By.tagName("a") to find by the tag of the elements
4. className --> By.class("something") to find by the class attribute. We can only use the class attribute if
                 the attribute does not have space in it (made of multiple classes)
5. linkText  --> By.linkText("Gmail") to find elements by the full text of a link. case sensitive, full match
                 link text visible on the screen. not the value of href attribute in html
6. partialLinkText --> By.partialLinkText("Gmail") to find elements by the partial text of a link, case sensitive
                       Link text is the visible text on the screen. not the value of href attribute in html
7. xpath
8. css
