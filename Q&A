What is Maven?
I am using Maven, so, I can manage my project easier and to automate this whole built proccess.
I don't want to have everythingseperately. I don't want to break this version of the code,
every single time I push it and pull it. So actually, I centralize all dependencies and everyone
is aware of which version all are we using.
---------------------------------------------
WINDOW HANDLING:
1. Window ID --> each window/tab has auto generated unique ID
2. driver.switchTo().window("window ID")
3. sriver.getWindowHandle() --> returns window ID (String)
4. sriver.getWindowHandles() --> return Set of window IDs. (Set<String>)
5. Loop through the window IDs and switch to each window and put condition where you want to stop looping.
---------------------------------------------
IFRAME -> Independent HTML inside another HTML
-> iframe or frame
1. driver.switchTo().frame 
   - index (int)
   - name or id (String)
   - WebElement (WebElement). Using regular locator 
2. driver.switchTo().parentFrame; -> direct parent frame
   driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); -> main page
---------------------------------------------   
ALERTS,POPUPS
2types:
1. Javascript alert (No HTML code)
   --> Alert type synta: Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert(); 
2. Web based popup (HTML code)
---------------------------------------------
PAGE OBJECT MODEL -> DESIGN PATTERN 
-> Creating the java classes that represents each page on the application.
* Inside the page classes we will store WebElements and methods related to that specific page.
** PageFactory --> class that comes from Selenium library.
               > It initializes all the WebElements that is in the page class.
