What is Maven?
I am using Maven, so, I can manage my project easier and to automate this whole built proccess. I don't want to have everything
seperately. I don't want to break this version of the code, every single time I push it and pull it. So actually, I centralize
all dependencies and everyone is aware of which version all are we using.

WINDOW HANDLING:
1. Window ID --> each window/tab has auto generated unique ID
2. driver.switchTo().window("window ID")
3. sriver.getWindowHandle() --> returns window ID (String)
4. sriver.getWindowHandles() --> return Set of window IDs. (Set<String>)
5. Loop through the window IDs and switch to each window and put condition where you want to stop looping.
