If you save your driver in this specific place: /usr/local/bin
You don't have to write System.set.property in your class.

What Is The Difference Between Assert And Verify In Selenium?

In simple words, if the assert condition is true then the program control will execute the next test step but if
the condition is false, the execution will stop and further test step will not be executed.
To overcome this we use Soft Assert in TestNG.


In simple words, there wont be any halt in the test execution even though the verify condition is true or false.
Note: In TestNG, we use only Assert Statements.  We can use Verify statement in terms of if-else and try-catch.
Verify is also a command which works with Selenium IDE and you have soft assert in TestNG, so both are same.
Since Selenium IDE is a just record and play tool so I would suggest you can continue with Webdriver with TestNG.




Asserts are used to perform validations in the test scripts.

There are two types of Assert:

Hard Assert
Soft Assert

Hard Assert – Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite continues with
next @Test
The disadvantage of Hard Assert – It marks method as fail if assert condition gets failed and the remaining statements
inside the method will be aborted. To overcome this we need to use Soft Assert. 

Soft Assert – Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and
would continue with the next step after the assert statement.

If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test
and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.
assertAll() is used to mark the test case as failed, if any soft assertion is getting failed.

We need to create an object to use Soft Assert which is not needed in Hard Assert.
