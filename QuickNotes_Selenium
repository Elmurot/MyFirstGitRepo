===============================Capture Screenshot in Selenium WebDriver using FileHandler Class===============================
In the latest version of Selenium, FileHandler class is implemented to capture screenshot instead of FileUtils.
We have to import package “org.openqa.selenium.io.FileHandler” to work with FileHandler class

	    TakesScreenshot ts=(TakesScreenshot)driver;
	    FileHandler.copy(ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE), new File("C:\\Selenium Project\\CaptureScreenshot.png"));

Before Selenium 3.6.0, Apache Commons Library comes along with Selenium. But in Selenium new versions from Selenium 3.6.0
onwards, we have to download it separately to use it in our project. You can download it from https://commons.apache.org/

If you are using Maven Project, here is the dependency of Apache Commons Library

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-io -->
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
<artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>
<version>1.3.2</version>

========================== WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver() ? Why we write in Selenium Scripts ==========================
SearchContext(findElement(),findElements()) is the super interface in selenium, which is extended by another interface called
WebDriver(get(),close()). All the abstract methods of SearchContext and WebDriver interfaces are implemented in RemoteWebDriver
class. All the browser related classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver etc., extends the RemoteWebdriver class.

WebDriver is an interface, driver is a reference variable, FirefoxDriver() is a Constructor, new is a keyword, and
new FirefoxDriver() is an Object. We cannot write our code like this (WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();) because we
cannot create Object of an Interface.

But we can use any of the following statements in our script

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
If you want to run you scripts only in one browser then it's totally fine to use above statement but in testing cross browser
testing is also very important.

If we want to run our automation scripts on the remote machine’s browser then we use RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver requires
the Selenium Standalone Server to be running but to use other drivers Selenium Standalone Server is not required.
===============================================================================================================================
==================================== Where you have applied OOPS in Automation Framework ? ====================================

ABSTRACTION
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. We utilize these
locators in tests but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.
Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation of internal details and showing the functionality to the users.

INTERFACE
Basic statement we all know in Selenium is WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); we are initializing
Chrome browser using Selenium WebDriver. It means we are creating a reference variable (driver) of the interface (WebDriver)
and creating an Object of ChromeDriver class. An interface can have methods and variables just like the class but the methods
declared in interface are by default abstract.

INHERITANCE
We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc.,
in the Base Class. We extend the Base Class in other classes such as Tests and Utility Class. Extending one class into other
class is known as Inheritance.

POLYMORPHISM
Combination of overloading and overriding is known as Polymorphism. We will see both overloading and overriding below.

METHOD OVERLOADING
We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps
such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading.

METHOD OVERRIDING
Declaring a method in child class which is already present in the parent class is called Method Overriding. Examples are
get() and navigate() methods of different drivers in Selenium .

ENCAPSULATION
All the classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy
and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.

WEB ELEMENT:
Web element is an interface used to identify the elements in a web page.

WEBDRIVER:
WebDriver is an interface used to launch different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.,

FIND BY:
FindBy is an annotation used in Page Object Model design pattern to identify the elements.

FIND ELEMENT:
Find Element is a method in POM to identify the elements in a web page.

==================== Top 7 Challenges in Test Automation {Challenges & Limitations in Selenium WebDriver} ====================

1. We cannot test windows application:
Selenium doesn’t support windows based applications. It supports only web-based applications.

2. We cannot test mobile apps:
We can test on any operating system and browser on the desktop using selenium but we cant deal mobile testing with selenium
alone. But there is a solution for this. You can use Appium to handle iOS and Android native, mobile, and hybrid apps using
the WebDriver protocol.

3. Limited reporting:
With selenium, you couldn’t generate a good report. But there is a workaround. You can generate reports using TestNG or
Extent reports.

4. Handling dynamic Elements:
Some of the web elements are dynamic in nature. If an element’s id is changing on every page load then it bit tricky to handle
this in the normal way. We need to handle the dynamic elements with dynamic xpath or dynamic css selectors. Functions like
starts-with, contains, ends with, etc., works well to handle dynamic objects.

5. Handling page load:
Some of the web pages are user specific. These user-specific pages load different elements depends on the different user.
Sometimes some elements appear depends upon the previous action. If you choose a country from country dropdown then cities
related that country will load in the cities dropdown. In runtime selenium script may not identify the element. To overcome
this we need to use explicit waits in the script to give the elements enough time to load and to identify the element.

6. Handling pop up windows:
Windows-based pops are part of the operating system. It’s beyond selenium’s capabilities. We could use AutoIT to handle the
windows based popups.

7. Handling captcha:
Handling captcha is a limitation in selenium. There are some third-party tools to automate captcha but still, we cannot
achieve 100% results.

If you save your driver in this specific place: /usr/local/bin
You don't have to write System.set.property in your class.

What Is The Difference Between Assert And Verify In Selenium?

In simple words, if the assert condition is true then the program control will execute the next test step but if
the condition is false, the execution will stop and further test step will not be executed.
To overcome this we use Soft Assert in TestNG.


In simple words, there wont be any halt in the test execution even though the verify condition is true or false.
Note: In TestNG, we use only Assert Statements.  We can use Verify statement in terms of if-else and try-catch.
Verify is also a command which works with Selenium IDE and you have soft assert in TestNG, so both are same.
Since Selenium IDE is a just record and play tool so I would suggest you can continue with Webdriver with TestNG.


Asserts are used to perform validations in the test scripts.

There are two types of Assert:

Hard Assert
Soft Assert

Hard Assert – Hard Assert throws an AssertException immediately when an assert statement fails and test suite continues with
next @Test
The disadvantage of Hard Assert – It marks method as fail if assert condition gets failed and the remaining statements
inside the method will be aborted. To overcome this we need to use Soft Assert. 

Soft Assert – Soft Assert collects errors during @Test. Soft Assert does not throw an exception when an assert fails and
would continue with the next step after the assert statement.

If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement in the @Test
and test suite again continue with next @Test as it is.
assertAll() is used to mark the test case as failed, if any soft assertion is getting failed.

We need to create an object to use Soft Assert which is not needed in Hard Assert.
